# QET-Energy-Entanglement-Relation

ABSTRACT

In the easiest terms possible, quantum entanglement means that two particles are together in such a way that the actions of one particle affect or cause changes to the other particle no matter the distance between the two particles. These particles could be photons, electrons, etc, and the state that they exist in could be, for example, one particle ‘spinning’ in one direction and the other spinning in the opposite direction. For our experiment, we consider two particles Alice and Bob. The goal of our study is to investigate the degree of breakdown of entanglement between the two for the minimal Quantum Energy Teleportation (QET) Model, during energy teleportation. Entropy is used as a quantitative measure of entanglement. The measurements in the circuit destroy the entanglement that exists between the two qubits when energy is transmitted from "Alice" to "Bob" in the Quantum Energy Teleportation (QET) Model. As a consequence, we use entropy to show the extent of degeneration in the entanglement; in other words, we present two disparities in the amount of transmitted energy and the entanglement expenditure. We investigate entanglement as a quantifiable physical resource in connection to energy in this experiment.
